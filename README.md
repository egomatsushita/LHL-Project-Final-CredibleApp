# Credible
By Mihalis, Eduardo, Laura

Credible aims to be a global review platform for independent sellers, and service providers ( entrepeneurs ) who want to port their good reputations to multiple platforms. Someone who sells on Ebay and wants to start selling on Etsy has to start garnering a new reputation all over again, but **Credible** solves that problem by providing an external platform and an embedable widget to include in other platforms.
